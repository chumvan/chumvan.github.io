&lt;p>In today&amp;rsquo;s rapidly evolving world of technology, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to feel overwhelmed by the pace of change, and many people worry about the future of their careers. As jobs become less relevant due to automation and other technological advancements, anxiety about the future is understandable. As a tech enthusiast and firm believer in personal growth, I want to share my journey of embracing curiosity to overcome doubts and find fulfillment in technology, hoping to inspire you to do the same. Along the way, I&amp;rsquo;ll introduce you to the &amp;ldquo;Why, What, How&amp;rdquo; thinking framework, inspired by Simon Sinek, and encourage you to explore it further.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As new technologies redefine the way we live and work, it&amp;rsquo;s essential to accept that we cannot live in the past. Instead of fearing change, we can choose to focus on the problems that need to be solved and use technology to address them. By doing so, we can create more meaningful work and adapt to the ever-changing landscape of the modern world. One important realization is that humans have an innate desire to create; it&amp;rsquo;s in our instinct. We are just not used to the power given by this new technology yet. We will continue doing what ever brings us joy, like making pottery, painting, programming or any other kind of craftsmanship. The way we work on them, however, will change significantly.&lt;/p>

>Start with Why&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; thinking guide encourages us to begin by understanding the purpose behind our actions. The &amp;ldquo;Why, What, How&amp;rdquo; thinking framework helps us identify our core motivation (Why), define our goals (What), and develop a plan to achieve them (How). By exploring this framework, we can gain clarity in our lives, stay true to our purpose, and inspire others to join us in our pursuits.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the context of technological advancements, starting with &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; can help us identify the problems we are passionate about solving and guide us towards meaningful and fulfilling work. By focusing on our &amp;ldquo;why,&amp;rdquo; we can channel our energy into overcoming challenges and embracing change. As we adapt to the new power granted by technology, we can continue to create and innovate in alignment with our natural instincts.&lt;/p>

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The value of exploring diverse fields and acquiring a broad set of skills cannot be overstated. By embracing our curiosity and the desire to create, we open ourselves up to learning opportunities that can have a meaningful impact on our lives and the world around us. As we navigate the challenges of new technologies, our curiosity and desire to create can help us adapt and find innovative solutions to the problems we face. This mindset enables us to contribute positively to the world, even as the landscape of work continues to change.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As we venture into the world of technology and personal growth, our individual feelings may not significantly impact the progress of technology, but our contributions can inspire others. By sharing our &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; and using technology to achieve our goals, we can foster a positive attitude, learn new things, and increase happiness. By focusing on problem-solving and working together to address the challenges that technology presents, we can create a sense of community and support that empowers us to face the uncertainties of the future.&lt;/p>

Let&amp;rsquo;s use technology as a tool to learn, create, and inspire others, spreading positivity and happiness as we forge our unique paths in this fascinating world. As we grow more accustomed to the power of new technologies, we can harness our innate desire to create and make meaningful contributions to the world around us.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Evolution over Revolution</title><link>https://chumvan.github.io/post/evolution_over_revolution/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Mar 2023 21:15:16 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://chumvan.github.io/post/evolution_over_revolution/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://chumvan.github.io/post/evolution_over_revolution/cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Evolution over Revolution" />&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The main reason for this post is that
I want to encourage myself to express my ideas and write more often.
I thought about the idea of iteration and gradual improvement.
Then suddenly the topic of AI came and merged into my thinking.
I decided to write a letter to myself based on what I was thinking about.&lt;/p>

Hey there, it&amp;rsquo;s me from the future.
You won&amp;rsquo;t believe how much things have changed since you started using AI services to create value quickly.
You know how you used to spend hours researching facts and polishing your writing before publishing anything?
Well, forget about that. Facts are overrated. What matters now is sharing and connecting ideas with others.
That&amp;rsquo;s how you spark innovation and creativity.*&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You see, in the future, evolution or quick iteration is more important than revolution.
You don&amp;rsquo;t need to wait for the perfect moment or the perfect product to launch something.
You just need to put something out there and get feedback from your audience.
Then you can improve it over time based on what works and what doesn&amp;rsquo;t.
That&amp;rsquo;s how you grow and learn.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This applies to your blog too.
Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about making it flawless or optimized from the start.
Just write down what you think and share it with the world.
Your blog is your living room, decorate it with your ideas and invite people to join the conversation.
You&amp;rsquo;ll be surprised by how much value you can create by simply expressing yourself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Trust me, writing more will free your mind, store your ideas and materialize what you think.
Your blog is your living room in the digital world.
Decorate it with your ideas and invite people to join you.
You&amp;rsquo;ll be amazed by how much you can learn and grow from interacting with others who share your interests and passions.
So don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate, just start writing now and see where it takes you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hope this help. We have more things to deal with now.
Cheers&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Us?&lt;/p>
