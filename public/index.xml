      <description>Imagine that you could start every day by eating a frog. Not a real frog, of course, but a metaphorical one: the most daunting and important task on your to-do list. That&amp;rsquo;s the idea behind the book &amp;ldquo;Eat that frog!&amp;rdquo; by Brian Tracy, which I haven&amp;rsquo;t read but was inspired by its catchy title. By eating your frog first thing in the morning, you can boost your productivity and confidence for the rest of the day.</description>

      <title>A boring tool</title>

      <description>The statement A good tool should be boring. This may sound counterintuitive, but let me explain why this is a profound insight that can help us achieve our most ambitious goals.
When we use a tool, we are not interested in the tool itself, but in what we can accomplish with it. We want to create something meaningful, solve a problem, or express ourselves. The tool is just a means to an end, not an end in itself.</description>

      <description>The experience I was in the E3 training program provided by super mentors from Ericsson last month. This program is designed to help employees develop their intrinsic motivation and live/work in harmony with their co-workers. It was a three-day journey full of learning, insights and fun!
One of the most interesting concepts that I learned during the training was the Johari Window. It is a technique that helps you understand yourself and others better by mapping out four areas of your personality: open, hidden, blind and unknown.</description>

      <title>Evolution over Revolution</title>

      <description>The main reason for this post is that I want to encourage myself to express my ideas and write more often. I thought about the idea of iteration and gradual improvement. Then suddenly the topic of AI came and merged into my thinking. I decided to write a letter to myself based on what I was thinking about.
&amp;quot; Hey there, it&amp;rsquo;s me from the future. You won&amp;rsquo;t believe how much things have changed since you started using AI services to create value quickly.</description>

      <title>On thinking</title>

      <description>Sometimes we spend hours, days, or even months worrying about things that aren’t actually that big of a deal. We tend to hope for a complicated or ‘mind-blowing’ solution to compensate for the effort we’ve put into the problem. But when we look back, the dots connect, and it all seems much simpler.
This analogy is applicable to life too. Deciding to take the first step can be the hardest part, as it requires us to make a decision with so much uncertainty, doubt, freedom and possibilities.</description>

      <description>I was initially reluctant to create this page, as I know that many people, myself included, are not fond of lengthy texts. Yet I also realized that sometimes they are necessary, especially when one wants to convey a comprehensive picture of one&amp;rsquo;s career and achievements. Perhaps there are some readers who enjoy absorbing this kind of information in this format. For those who don&amp;rsquo;t, I would much rather meet them face-to-face and let them get to know me personally.</description>
