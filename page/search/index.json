[{"content":"The inception I was in the E3 training program provided by super mentors from Ericsson last month. This program is designed to help employees develop their intrinsic motivation and live/work in harmony with their co-workers. It was a three-day journey full of learning, insights and fun!\nOne of the most interesting concepts that I learned during the training was the Johari Window. It is a technique that helps you understand yourself and others better by mapping out four areas of your personality: open, hidden, blind and unknown. I love the idea of using the Johari Window to explore different aspects of my personality and how they affect my relationships with others. It\u0026rsquo;s like having four rooms in my house that represent different parts of me. The open area is the living room where I can invite people in and share who I am openly and confidently. The hidden area is my bedroom where I keep some secrets and personal things that only I know or choose to reveal. The blind area is the aroma of my house that others can smell but I can\u0026rsquo;t. It\u0026rsquo;s the feedback and impressions that others have of me that I may not be aware of or accept. The unknown area is my attic where there are things that are hidden from both me and others. It\u0026rsquo;s the potential and possibilities that I have not discovered yet or that are waiting to be uncovered.\nThe goal of using the Johari Window is to expand your open area by disclosing more information about yourself and receiving feedback from others. This way, you can reduce your hidden and blind areas and discover more about your unknown potential. By doing this, you can improve your communication, trust and relationships with others.\nThe practice The practice is to draw four areas on a paper that represent the four rooms of your house: the open area (living room), the hidden area (bedroom), the blind area (aroma), and the unknown area (attic). Then, step on your bedroom area and decide if you want to open your heart and answer questions from others. You can choose to share something personal or private that you usually keep to yourself, such as a fear, a dream, a hobby, or a memory. This will help you to expand your open area and reduce your hidden area.\nAlternatively, you can ask others to give you honest feedback about how they perceive you or what they think of your actions or behaviors. This will help you to discover your blind area and learn something new about yourself that you may not be aware of or accept. You can also ask them to share their opinions or suggestions on how you can improve yourself or achieve your goals. This will help you to explore your unknown area and uncover your potential and possibilities.\nThe \u0026ldquo;bring-home\u0026rdquo; I found this idea very useful because it made me realize how much I can learn from other people\u0026rsquo;s perspectives and how much I can share with them to create a deeper connection. I also realized that there are many aspects of myself that I\u0026rsquo;m not aware of or that I haven\u0026rsquo;t explored yet.\nIf you want to try this technique for yourself, you can use this online tool that allows you to choose some adjectives that describe you and then ask your friends or colleagues to do the same. Or, just use the same practice I described. You will see a grid that shows how much overlap or difference there is between your self-image and their perception of you.\nAnd, of course, the book Should we read more about this idea, together? I found this book interesting.\nAmazing image from Night Cafe Studio\n","date":"2023-03-05T11:37:15+02:00","permalink":"https://chumvan.github.io/post/johariwindow/","title":"Johari's Window"},{"content":" The main reason for this post is that I want to encourage myself to express my ideas and write more often. I thought about the idea of iteration and gradual improvement. Then suddenly the topic of AI came and merged into my thinking. I decided to write a letter to myself based on what I was thinking about.\n\u0026quot; Hey there, it\u0026rsquo;s me from the future. You won\u0026rsquo;t believe how much things have changed since you started using AI services to create value quickly. You know how you used to spend hours researching facts and polishing your writing before publishing anything? Well, forget about that. Facts are overrated. What matters now is sharing and connecting ideas with others. That\u0026rsquo;s how you spark innovation and creativity.*\nYou see, in the future, evolution or quick iteration is more important than revolution. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to wait for the perfect moment or the perfect product to launch something. You just need to put something out there and get feedback from your audience. Then you can improve it over time based on what works and what doesn\u0026rsquo;t. That\u0026rsquo;s how you grow and learn.\nThis applies to your blog too. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about making it flawless or optimized from the start. Just write down what you think and share it with the world. Your blog is your living room, decorate it with your ideas and invite people to join the conversation. You\u0026rsquo;ll be surprised by how much value you can create by simply expressing yourself.\nTrust me, writing more will free your mind, store your ideas and materialize what you think. Your blog is your living room in the digital world. Decorate it with your ideas and invite people to join you. You\u0026rsquo;ll be amazed by how much you can learn and grow from interacting with others who share your interests and passions. So don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate, just start writing now and see where it takes you.\nI hope this help. We have more things to deal with now. Cheers\nUs?\n\u0026quot;\n","date":"2023-03-01T21:15:16+02:00","permalink":"https://chumvan.github.io/post/evolutionoverrevolution/","title":"Evolution over Revolution"},{"content":"\nSometimes we spend hours, days, or even months worrying about things that aren’t actually that big of a deal. We tend to hope for a complicated or ‘mind-blowing’ solution to compensate for the effort we’ve put into the problem. But when we look back, the dots connect, and it all seems much simpler.\nThis analogy is applicable to life too. Deciding to take the first step can be the hardest part, as it requires us to make a decision with so much uncertainty, doubt, freedom and possibilities. But once we’ve taken the first step, we’re filled with confidence and acceptance.\nI’m still figuring out how to apply this to my own life, but here are a few things that I’m trying to do to help me along the way:\nTake it easy - if you can’t solve a problem today, try again tomorrow. Give yourself time and space, and you may even forget about the problem altogether. Write down your thoughts. It’s amazing how something we can’t seem to escape from can be summarised in 3-4 sentences. Talk to someone you trust. The answer to many of our problems may not be absolute, but the solutions start with the right attitude. So why not give it a try?\n[1] Image from reddit*\n","date":"2023-02-25T13:45:00+02:00","permalink":"https://chumvan.github.io/post/onthinking/","title":"On thinking"},{"content":"Just a person trying to find out what to do in his life next.\n","date":"2023-02-06T16:15:42+02:00","permalink":"https://chumvan.github.io/post/about/","title":"About"}]
